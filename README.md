# OOD-Detector-Tests-Pipeline

This is the repository for testing OOD detectors on weather-transformed and adversarial-attacked conditions. This repository currently provides code to generate adversarial-attacked images and test their impact on ADS models. Further code will be posted on this repository shortly.
